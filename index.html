												<p>At 2015, worldwide Internet users are more than <strong>3 billions</strong>. The Internet has become an essential and unavoidable part of our life. Nowadays, almost nothing gets done without it. However, could our blind dependence in it be a threat to ourselves? Would we be able to live without it?
													Is it possible that somehow it may not be around in the near future? Most people spend their daily lives as if Internet has always been here and always will be. However, its success is not a proof of its endless permanence. It would be unwise to think it will always be around.

				<h1>The Internet suddenly disappears</h1>
				<p>
					The Internet is <strong>robust</strong>. It's not dependent upon a single machine or cable. It's a network made up of other computer networks. It spans the globe. Connections cross over continents, under oceans and through space via satellites. And as the Internet has grown, so has our dependence upon it.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Internet is <strong>reliable</strong>. Data that travels around it takes always different paths: even if entire sections of the Internet were to go offline in the wake of disasters or attacks, other sections could remain functional.
				</p>
				<p>
					To imagine the world without the Internet means first of all to imagine the really dangerous possible scenarios that could cause it to collapse.

				<h1>#1: A DNS Attack</h1>

				<p>
				The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name System</a>

				A DNS server compromised by a hacker could be used to funnel Web surfers to all sorts of phishing attacks and malicious Web sites and even cause havoc with directory services and e-mail in some cases, according to the father of the technology, Paul Mockapetris.
“Once you control the DNS server, you have license to do phishing and farming attacks and mislead all the users of that DNS server,” says Mockapetris, who in 1983 proposed the Domain Name System (DNS) architecture and is acknowledged, along with the late Jon Postel, as the technology’s inventor.
The issue is a timely topic after Microsoft announced late Thursday that a vulnerability exists in its DNS server that could allow a hacker to take over the service.
Mockapetris says users with the Microsoft DNS server also should be concerned about Active Directory because the DNS holds start-up configuration data for the directory.
“E-mail is routed via DNS, so if you took over DNS you could misdirect e-mail. There is a lot of opportunity there,” Mockapetris says.
The key is that DNS holds a trusted relationship with users because it is the node that directs them to Web sites based on the URLs that are typed into a browser’s address bar or clicked on from a “Favorites” menu. “The trust relationship is hierarchical. So what you get to do if you take over a DNS server is you get to confuse all of the clients that depend on that DNS server,” Mockapetris says.
He says attacks to try and add bogus information to DNS servers or completely take them over have been around for quite some time. Microsoft’s DNS vulnerability just opens up another avenue that is likely more of a danger to corporate users.
A hacker controlling a DNS server would have access to DNS logs to determine sites users go to, such as a bank, and they could alter DNS records to redirect users to a bogus site that looks like the bank and then record password and other sensitive data. Users also could be redirected to hacker Web sites that would install malicious code on end-user PCs.
“If you take over the box, you can tell users whatever you like in response to their DNS queries,” says Mockapetris. “You can see where people want to go and decide the most effective way to attack those users based on their patterns.”
The attacks can go on relatively unnoticed given the trust inherent in DNS and the fact that it works behind the scenes.
“If a DNS server misdirects a request, a sophisticated user might notice but the vast majority of users won’t,” he says.
