												<p>At 2015, worldwide Internet users are more than <strong>3 billions</strong>. The Internet has become an essential and unavoidable part of our life. Nowadays, almost nothing gets done without it. However, could our blind dependence in it be a threat to ourselves? Would we be able to live without it?
													Is it possible that somehow it may not be around in the near future? Most people spend their daily lives as if Internet has always been here and always will be. However, its success is not a proof of its endless permanence. It would be unwise to think it will always be around.

				<h1>The Internet suddenly disappears</h1>
				<p>
					The Internet is <strong>robust</strong>. It's not dependent upon a single machine or cable. It's a network made up of other computer networks. It spans the globe. Connections cross over continents, under oceans and through space via satellites. And as the Internet has grown, so has our dependence upon it.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Internet is <strong>reliable</strong>. Data that travels around it takes always different paths: even if entire sections of the Internet were to go offline in the wake of disasters or attacks, other sections could remain functional.
				</p>
				<p>
					To imagine the world without the Internet means first of all to imagine the really dangerous possible scenarios that could cause it to collapse.

				<h1>#1: A DNS Attack</h1>

				<img src="img/servers.png" alt="Title" height="150" width="150"/>

				<p>
				The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">Domain Name System</a> is the hierarchical system for Internet services.
				The most important job of the DNS is the translation of the websites URL we use every day into the computer-readable numerical IP addresses that are used in order to connect to a website.
				The DNS is structured as a hierarchy of servers interconnected through the world.
				The father of the technology, Paul Mockapetris, has confirmed that a physical or virtual attack to the DNS structure would open to the attackers the possibility to step in between the communication between the users and the website, basically blocking the Internet functioning.
				“If you take over the box, you can tell users whatever you like in response to their DNS queries,” says Mockapetris.

				<h1>#2: A physical attack on the cables</h1>

				<img src="img/cables.png" alt="Title" height="150" width="150"/>

				<p>
					The Internet is based on an infrastructure that exploits a complex system of cables undersea. A physical attack on it, meaning a cut of the cables, would lead to a total loss of data exchange.
					Take, for instance, the severing of three underwater optical cables in 2008, which led to widespread outages in India, Egypt, and other Middle Eastern countries. After an investigation, authorities attributed the damage to dropped anchors.

			<h1>#3: Zombie networks attack</h1>

			<img src="img/bots.png" alt="Title" height="150" width="150"/>

			<p>
				Untold numbers of enslaved PCs are waiting to do the bidding of shadowy hackers. Matt Sergeant of MessageLabs puts the size of the Storm botnet at between 5 and 10 million machines (though others peg the size of the network at much less.) Today, bots fill our inboxes with spam.
				But in the past, they’ve been used to take out companies and countries and to blackmail sites. In the end, it’s an arms race in which only one side has to play by the rules.

			<h1>#4: A solar flare</h1>

			<img src="img/sun.png" alt="Title" height="150" width="150"/>

			<p>
				The most possibly option for the end of the Internet, though, does not come from human threats: it comes from outside.
				<a href="http://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/reports/space-weather-full-report">Space weather</a> can have great impact on the global communication system and could potentially put the entire global connectivity at the mercy of space.
				We can be subject to a future massive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare">solar flare</a> just like we are subject to the sun’s rays. The most gigantic one, known as the Carrington Flare, took place in 1859. It crippled the telegraphic communication all across North America and Europe.
				Computer engineers and space physicists are well aware of what a solar flare the size of Carrington would do to today’s extremely vulnerable communication infrastructure.
				A major solar event could theoretically melt down the whole Internet. What earthquakes, bombs, and terrorism cannot do might be accomplished in moments by a solar corona.
